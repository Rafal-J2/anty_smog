# AntySmog

AntySmog is a mobile application that monitors the air quality in our surroundings. The app utilizes data from public air quality sensors to provide users with up-to-date information on the concentration of pollutants such as PM10 and PM2.5.

**Introduction**

AntySmog makes it easy to check the level of air pollution, providing a map to review the current air quality in selected cities or across the entire country of Poland. Utilizing approximately 1500 sensors, AntySmog offers real-time updates on the measurements of PM10 and PM2.5 particles. All sensors are installed on school buildings and are equipped with LED displays that present the current concentration of PM2.5 dust outside schools. This serves as a vital piece of information not only for teachers, students, and parents but also for the entire local community.
